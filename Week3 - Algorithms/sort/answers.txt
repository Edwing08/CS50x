sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: It has different runtimes when it comes to sorting list of numbers random and sorted (O and Omega are different).
Good performance in the list of sorted numbers. Also, the sorting times are quite high compared to the other sorting algorithms on larger
lists of numbers.

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: It has similar runtimes when it comes to sorting each list of numbers (O and Omega are similar).
Also, the sorting times are quite low compared to the other sorting algorithms on larger lists of numbers.

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: It has similar runtimes when it comes to sorting each list of numbers (O and Omega are similar).
the main distinction compared to the "merge sort" is the higher runtime on larger lists of numbers.
